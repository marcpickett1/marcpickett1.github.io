title: "The Meaning of Life"
---

[#]: Read through, keep reader in mind.  Edit. CUT
[#]: take out non-English, aim for clarity, and little effort on the reader's part
[#]: Weltanschauung
[#]: Gedankenexperiment

[#]: eble add pictures (e.g., for squiggly lines)

[#]: eble rename, take out pretense of explaining meaning of life
[#]: recap main points so that Matt, Jason, and Renee don't miss points
[#]: print out.  Read through printed version.  Edit. CUT
[#]: put in newpages so memes aren't broken up
[#]: print out.  Read through printed version once more

[#]: Rework section 8
[#]: Go through Section 8 and see which parts are theory and which are applications put
[#]: application (or questions or motivation 1st), then put theory, then put conclusions eble
[#]: interweave them, but use 2 different fonts (or boxes) to distinguish

[#]: I should be able to make a very interesting grounded smutty story.  These questions are
[#]: important and have applications in a reality of Blut und Fleisch!  This is so motivated that
[#]: it doesn't have to be dry at all.

[#]: Eble the whole thing could be motivated by Section 8, could also disguise as story (wie
[#]: Nietzsche's Zarathustra), don't actually say it's about the meaning of life

# part{Theory}


I've divided this memex into a part on *Theory*, which presents a collection of
"intuition-pumps" and thought-tools, and a part on *Applications*, which presents a set
of problems that might be addressed using these tools.
* **Happiness of Rabbits: A Thought Experiment About Evolution** We can gain some insights by
  looking at life from a "designer's" point of view.  The notion of *happiness* or a Will
  might be useful from this point of view.
* **Walking = Falling + Catching** Permanent happiness can never be achieved, or at least that
  it'd be a bad from a designer's point of view.  This chapter goes more into some mechanisms a
  designer might want to put into an organism.  This is then used to explain why we can never
  have enough **Closet Space**.
* **Enter Complexity: The Peacock's Tail** Life isn't so straightforward for some evolutionary
  organisms.  This is due to a recursive hall-of-mirrors that produces virtually boundless
  complexity.
* **Will: Interaction of Cognitive System and Reward System** We have 2 systems in our head,
  which might result in 2 different fundamental meanings of life.
* **Squiggly Lines** Perception is non-trivial, and this means that the designer's meaning of
  life doesn't always agree with the organism's.
* **Taste is like the Butt, Divided** Learning can affect our preferences.  Also, {\bf
  Specifying Reward: The Bulldog Anal Rapin' Robot\copyright} expands on the Squiggly Lines
  idea and that specifying an innate Will is tricky and hacked.  Perhaps one of the most
  impoortant sections to understanding happiness is **Hill Climbing on the Cingulate
  Cortex**, which further expands on the Bulldog A.R.R.\ idea to show that finding what makes us
  happy is essentially a "hillclimbing" search. **Some Strategies for Maximizing Reward**
  further details how that search might work.
* **Artificial Sweetener, Drugs, and Virtual Reality** We can exploit the "bugs" in our
  design.  The section on **Habits and Pain** explains why habits are necessary and why pain
  is a good thing.  Also, why **Hedonism** is inadequate as an approach to finding a meaning
  of life.
* **Economics and Ethics** Ethics emerges from utility maximization in multi-player games, and
  this is another source of virtually boundless complexity.
* **Atomic Waves and Platonic Forms** People are really just waves of atoms, the meaning of
  life is an abstraction, and there might be an "ideal" meaning of life.
* **Designing your Successor** The notion of reproduction only makes sense if the "self" is
  well defined.  With genetic engineering and artificial intelligence, the idea of a self
  becomes blurry.
* **Entropy: A Petri Dish Falling into a Volcano** For any organism that is forced to make
  decisions (including people), nihilism is impossible.  This is true even if the entire
  universe is inevitably doomed to fizzle out due to entropy.
* **Consciousness and Death (How a person never dies)** Our own death is fundamentally
  different from that of others.  Also, how a deterministic system, such as a chess playing
  program, can have **Free Will**.

The chapter on **Boundless Will and Finiteness of Life** presents a set of problems that I
still haven't resolved about how to live my own life: How does one live optimally?  This is the
least organized chapter because it's the least conclusive.  The questions are still open, so
this chapter should be the most alive, or equivalently, the least set in stone.  One conclusion
of the chapter is that laziness and fear make sense from an evolutionary perspective, but are
now overly influential.
