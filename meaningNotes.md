# part{Theory}

I've divided this memex into a part on *Theory*, which presents a collection of
"intuition-pumps" and thought-tools, and a part on *Applications*, which presents a set
of problems that might be addressed using these tools.
* **Happiness of Rabbits: A Thought Experiment About Evolution** We can gain some insights by
  looking at life from a "designer's" point of view.  The notion of *happiness* or a Will
  might be useful from this point of view.
* **Walking = Falling + Catching** Permanent happiness can never be achieved, or at least that
  it'd be a bad from a designer's point of view.  This chapter goes more into some mechanisms a
  designer might want to put into an organism.  This is then used to explain why we can never
  have enough **Closet Space**.
* **Enter Complexity: The Peacock's Tail** Life isn't so straightforward for some evolutionary
  organisms.  This is due to a recursive hall-of-mirrors that produces virtually boundless
  complexity.
* **Will: Interaction of Cognitive System and Reward System** We have 2 systems in our head,
  which might result in 2 different fundamental meanings of life.
* **Squiggly Lines** Perception is non-trivial, and this means that the designer's meaning of
  life doesn't always agree with the organism's.
* **Taste is like the Butt, Divided** Learning can affect our preferences.  Also, {\bf
  Specifying Reward: The Bulldog Anal Rapin' Robot\copyright} expands on the Squiggly Lines
  idea and that specifying an innate Will is tricky and hacked.  Perhaps one of the most
  impoortant sections to understanding happiness is **Hill Climbing on the Cingulate
  Cortex**, which further expands on the Bulldog A.R.R.\ idea to show that finding what makes us
  happy is essentially a "hillclimbing" search. **Some Strategies for Maximizing Reward**
  further details how that search might work.
* **Artificial Sweetener, Drugs, and Virtual Reality** We can exploit the "bugs" in our
  design.  The section on **Habits and Pain** explains why habits are necessary and why pain
  is a good thing.  Also, why **Hedonism** is inadequate as an approach to finding a meaning
  of life.
* **Economics and Ethics** Ethics emerges from utility maximization in multi-player games, and
  this is another source of virtually boundless complexity.
* **Atomic Waves and Platonic Forms** People are really just waves of atoms, the meaning of
  life is an abstraction, and there might be an "ideal" meaning of life.
* **Designing your Successor** The notion of reproduction only makes sense if the "self" is
  well defined.  With genetic engineering and artificial intelligence, the idea of a self
  becomes blurry.
* **Entropy: A Petri Dish Falling into a Volcano** For any organism that is forced to make
  decisions (including people), nihilism is impossible.  This is true even if the entire
  universe is inevitably doomed to fizzle out due to entropy.
* **Consciousness and Death (How a person never dies)** Our own death is fundamentally
  different from that of others.  Also, how a deterministic system, such as a chess playing
  program, can have **Free Will**.

The chapter on **Boundless Will and Finiteness of Life** presents a set of problems that I
still haven't resolved about how to live my own life: How does one live optimally?  This is the
least organized chapter because it's the least conclusive.  The questions are still open, so
this chapter should be the most alive, or equivalently, the least set in stone.  One conclusion
of the chapter is that laziness and fear make sense from an evolutionary perspective, but are
now overly influential.

    Meme 37. Because this world is a piece of shit. An unfair piece of shit. With an unfair
    amount of pain and suffering. And we are not here for any purpose or for any plan. And we
    are not guaranteed pleasure or happiness nor promised the avoidance of pain and
    suffering. All we are is an inevitability. Given a large enough universe, or given some
    environment suited to life, these chemical reactions will occur. We understand ourselves to
    be physical anomalies, coincidences, exceptions, rarities or neat gadgets that happened to
    happen. Like the Grand Canyon. To bring a child into the world is to knowingly bring another
    consciousness into a world of pain and suffering. And there is no point or purpose. And you
    want to prolong this chain?

  Could you use the same argument to justify murder?  I.e., if non-existence is better than
  existence, then you'd be doing someone a favor by killing them (sending their consciousness
  into oblivion).

Hypothetically yes. Realistically, no.

If you could somehow show that a eugenics program would result in a healthier and happier
society, then the utilitarian would be for it. (Let us suppose this program required murdering
or nuking some part of the population, to make room.) If we were rather automatic creatures,
that didn't get emotionally hung up on such things, then perhaps we would immediately forget.

Realistically, the thoughts of such things would put fear and sorrow into people. And such a
program cannot be instantiated without causing more pain than pleasure.

One argument is, if you can guarantee that the sum of everyone's lives will be negative, then it
would be better to nuke the world now for net positive. But how can we possibly claim that in
future human generations, we would not surpass negativity with happiness?

Check out antinatalism.

Could you set up ants into circuits which open or fire or return true, or whatever, as some
series of paths and food rewards? And then design a circuit to calculate primes. If we could
somehow ensure that a food reward occurred only when primes were calculated, could we get the
ants to eventually optimize themselves, and show us a faster way of calculating primes?

What about moral decisions? Can we make a leader ant learn that a food reward will result in a
hose washing out an area of his countrymen? Eventually see if ants will readily choose to
sacrifice the smaller of two groups.

But I don't think they're thinking that much.

Meme 40. Your use of pain is loaded here. Relying on what the reader thinks pain is. Why can't
pain merely be a signal? Why does it have to hurt?

Meme 43. I don't yet know that: (Rats keep pressing button) --> (Rats view pleasure as ultimate
goal in life.)

Suppose there were a drug or electric impulse or whatever, which general message was, "Do some
action, and then repeat it again." Or, "Do not resist pressing the big green button again." And
then, when I do, I get kicked in the balls. But i certainly don't think me getting kicked in the
balls until I die is the meaning of life.

Meme 44. You say, "Drugs and VR certainly weren't anticipated by evolution." Was the eye
anticipated by evolution? What about wings? Or the brain?

I think someday, perhaps soon, there will be so much augmented reality in reality, in so little
reality in reality, that you will not know what the difference is. In this future, your "pride"
in knowing something is fake will disappear with your ability to distinguish what's real from
what's fake.

Meme 45. It depends on what you're trying to maximize. Legacy or happiness. Your tautology at
the end can be rephrased with happiness. "Certainly, rabbits that tried to maximize their
happiness would have more happiness than those that didn't."

We've been over that though so blah blah blah.

How do you know:

Suvivability(Happiness Seekers) < Survivability(Legacy extenders)?

Perhaps if someone aims for happiness, they are healthy and attractive to mates. But if people
are concerned with their legacy, they are stressed, prone to heart attack, and not considered
fun. If the "legacy extender" truly wanted to maximize survivability, he would switch his modus
operandi to being a happiness seeker. (in the hypothetical where the environment rewards
happiness seekers over legacy extenders, (or those who aim or intend to extend their legacies).)

Meme 51. Meme 51 is all over the place.

Maybe some atoms in our bodies are not replaced.

Maybe the definition of a person isn't their wave, but their computational algorithm.

Maybe the definition of a person is substrate dependent.

As long as we don't know what consciousness is, the relationship between consciousness and
cognition, and the relationship between computation and physical systems, we can't really speak
about anything, so much as speculate.

I think also, the question of identity is an open one. It is possible that identity does exist,
under reasonable definitions, or that it doesn't exist, under reasonable assumptions. And I
think it'll be a little while before we can determine which paradigm is right or preferable.

In regard to imagining a perfect person… This seems too theological for me. There is no
such thing as a perfect person because there is not a goal set. And perhaps there are no goal
posts!

For example, the other day I told my housemate that if she were perfect, she would not forget
things in conversation, nor would she have cramps. If we take this further, we might ask if the
perfect version of her knows when to stay quiet, or volunteer relevant information. Or even, if
there were a perfect version of her, she would not be wasting time with me, but would rather be
out helping the world.

I find the concept of perfection collapses as I try to grasp it.

Meme 52. Yes. Everything is wavy. Or everything is stringy. Or everything is objecty. Or
everything is functiony. Or everything is a Turing machine, or a Post machine, or a lamda
calculus, or a cellular automata, or a finite state machine, or a LISP program, or a set.

Everything is everything.

Meme 53. Our physical theories suggest the world is real. At least. And imaginary. Complex. At
least real.

But nonetheless, a Turing machine can compute a real universe to arbitrary precision with
computable reals.

If chihuahuas are a contradiction, then why isn't the universe exploding? Are you suggesting the
universe does not obey classical logic? And if not, which logic does it obey?

Your "idea system" sounds like dualism.

"In physics, the principle of locality states that an object is influenced directly only by its
immediate surroundings. Experiments have shown that quantum mechanically entangled particles
must violate either the principle of locality or the form of philosophical realism known as
counterfactual definiteness."

Meme 54 seems to resemble my response to Meme 51.

Meme 57 seems like the kind of stuff that prolongs religious wars and discourages interracial
marriage.

Also, in earlier memes, the concept of ideal genes sounds awfully nazi-esque. And the idea that
you compare Hare Wars to Core Wars makes it seem like you are a proponent of social darwinism.

And what about our care for the weaker of our species? Is it necessary? Or was it merely
formerly useful, but now simply irrational?

Meme 58. In a way, 1 year is 100 years, (except in face of the singularity.) Otherwise, these
ponderings remind me of Camus. Seen through her character Mersault's thoughts on when his life
will end at the end of "The Stranger", and in his essay "The Myth of Sisyphus" which tries to
examine why would should not commit suicide?

Life is learning how to live while preparing to die.

Meme 62. Assuming the Church-Turing thesis, then human consciousness is turing machines. Turing
machines are natural numbers. I can print the natural numbers in sequence.

Meme 63. This is solipsistic nonsense. We know the world continues after us because it is the
simplest explanation.

As, if you slow Lappy's processor enough, maybe he is a rock consciousness. Also, if you just
suspend the process, maybe he is dead, and when you resume it, it is reinstantiated.

Consider the timeline of your life, like frames on a film. Now cut them up based on each time
you fall asleep. Now scramble them up. Maybe you just live one day randomly after the other, but
they feel in order to you.

How do you know the world wasn't created 5 minutes ago with false memories in you?

How do you know the world wasn't created 7 minutes ago?

Meme 64 says what I just said about Lappy.

Meme 66. Most anything that I can phrase that I can't immediately see leading to contradiction,
I can imagine. Thus, I can imagine changing your genome, or your brain, in such a way that you
are more or less in all ways the same Marc, but when thrown off a cliff you are nonchalant and
indifferent.

Any system which can pass a Turing test deserves rights.

You say robots' will should always be subservient to the will of the people. This is a strange
ought claim. Arguably the robots are our descendants, and extensions of us, our perfections
realized. And if they should overtake us, well, perhaps they should.

Your last paragraph seems evangelical/dogmatic. That humans have these things, pleasure and
pain. But robots just have these other things called signals. What can't a computer do that a
human can't? How does a human do it? And why can't a machine that mimics it's physical behavior
be replicated?

I'm gonna want a citation that males of some insects take action to be eaten. That they happen
to be eaten is one thing. But what I've heard, male spiders try to flee, or trick females into
eating first before humping.

Meme 69. Have you ever watch Ghost in the Shell? I think you'd like it.

Meme 78. Knuth says premature optimization is the root of all evil. But how does that guide us
in determining when we are prematurely optimizing, or how we can prevent it?

Meme 80. In HCI "pro-users" turn into "mediocre users" when the software is upgraded. Either the
old functionality is left in, and old users use old inefficient paths, where as newer users
learn faster paths or more efficient hotkeys. If in future versions the toolbars are changed
dramatically, the older users get pissed off.

But if you claim that any time you fall into a routine you'll intentionally try to break it is
silly. Probably those toolbars aren't gonna changed for a long time. Probably you should just
fall into a routine for a while.

How is one encouraged to seize the day in this economy? Should anyone really be taking business
chances, or should they be grateful for the jobs they got?

Meme 83. There's this guy here at NRL named… Whose name I can't remember. Works in the
immersive simulation lab. He told me something like it takes soldiers twice as long, or 66% more
time, to learn a virtual environment, rather than a real physical one. I don't remember what he
said or why it was true.

Meme 85. Kalyan told me about how he observed this. How it is interesting how far children stray
from their parent/guardian. They want to push a boundary, but they also don't want to be scared.

Meme 87. I think it might be because of competition. If all bands have the same instruments, it
is easier to compare their talent as better or worse. Then distortion becomes like steroids and
the questions of where the bounds are.

Ordering at McDonald's is annoying. I have to order some things in negative. Like, I need to
positively order lettuce and tomato, but I need to explicitly say no sauce or no cheese. If I
fall into the habit of saying "add lettuce, add tomato, no sauce," only, and successfully have
no cheese, then one day there will be cheese on it because I didn't say it explicitly.

Meme 130. Reading means 130 and 129 bum me out. I can't help but feel there are enlightened
states where the truths or implications of the things you typed are responded to with happiness.

In regard to all possible thoughts: I have thought that total knowledge is knowledge of all
sentences.

Lately I've been thinking about the set of all sets. And how this concept related to god. So, in
ZFC the set of all sets doesn't exist because it is a paradox. But Quine formulated the
universal set with different foundations.

Anyway, I already know certain things like Godel's incompleteness theorem show things are
inaccessible to me, even if life were infinite. It seems that an enlightened state would somehow
achieve a proper attitude toward the inaccessible.

Meme 128. A certain negative attitude is presented here. For example, even if you have a
wonderful girlfriend, every year you might say, "That was this year, 3#. I will never be able to
have sex with a different set of women for this age of mine." Yet, to do this would be foolish,
if you have a rewarding relationship. (Or is that happiness delusional, at least when compared
to optimums?)

It also sounds like you want transcendence. To quote Led Zeppelin, "Many times I've wondered how
much there is to know." I think people think this is god. At least, I did when i was younger. I
imagined in heaven there would be a big chalk board where god wrote infinity along with all
other math equations and all questions would be answered to me.

I guess this idea I had when I was young wasn't too far off from Erdos' concept of god as the
supreme fascist and holder of the book of mathematical theorems.

Essentially, I, like you, want to know and experience everything, or however I need to qualify
that to make it true. And I think this is more or less achievable through the singularity,
although at the expense of identity. In what way are Marc and Ramzi different when we know all
the same things, think in the same ways, and are bodiless? We need to examine our value of
identity.

Meme 91: Since I was young, I have had a certain fondness for the idea that: Total knowledge is
the set of all sentences.

The thoughts that you want to think can be thought by a program permuting over
thought. Preserving you or me would be like paying special credence to a system file from an old
installation of an operating system. Perhaps without it progress would have been slowed.

But our contributions. Our thoughts. Our works. They are small compared to what I can imagine,
almost by definition.

In a way, choosing to work in AI obliterates your legacy. If you wanted more of a legacy, you
would fight AI and human progress, and just working on curing disease.

After the AI, they will see our pride as we see vanity.

Meme 91. I spent a long time thinking about the Nietzsche quote. And then I typed all that stuff
that was unrelated to it.

But the earth did not have meaning. Perhaps cell structures in our bodies do not know that they
have a purpose, but we know that they do, and they work to serve us.

The earth did not intend for us to sprout from it.

We have no evidence to suggest that the humans' role on earth is part of a large galactic
system, just as we have no evidence that quantum events are impactful on consciousness. (Do we?)
They're just there.

The human's role in the planetary orbit is non-vital. The role of the mitochondria is vital to
us. The human and the mitochondria are part of the same causal system. The human and the
planetary orbit are part of different causal systems.

See: Gaia theory.

Meme 94. Along with parsimony, universality is an axiom of science.

I remember when I was in high school, I bet my health teacher that humans only had 5 senses. I
lost that bet. And there were many senses that we have that I probably naively grouped as the
same. For example, detecting pressure, or detecting hot and cold. I'd just call that touch.

Perhaps if you expanded out parsimony and universality, you will find that their sub-components
number hundreds of pages. (Though I don't think so.)

/From //this proposition/ <http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/pm54.43.html>/it will follow, when
arithmetical addition has been defined, that 1+1=2./

Principia Mathematica, Volume I, page 360

I got that page number after Googling and finding this page:
http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/mmset.html

It had some stuff about axioms vs. axiom schemes which I didn't really understand, but maybe it
is related to this Meme 94.

Meme 93 Revised:

One could claim that Science and Religion are both axiomatic belief systems. That is, both
science and religion start with a set of assumptions (e.g., "God exists." for religion, and
Ockham's Razor for Science) that have no backing and on which other beliefs are based.
Since Science and Religion are both systems of axioms, one might claim that there is no
fundamental difference between them, and therefore, belief in Science is as justified as belief
in Religion.

However, Religion isn't a set of specific beliefs, but rather a set of principles for
generating beliefs, so the axioms are few. For example, The Law of Transubstantiation (i.e.,
"For every eucharist there is the body of christ") is not a core belief of religion. The core
tenets of religion allow that transubstantiation might not be entirely correct.  When Jesus
proposed this law, it was a most holy statement that was stated by God. The tenets of Religion
allow both that a more holier statement might still be made and that new decrees by God will
make God's older decrees incomprehensible. By contrast, the axioms of science are specific and
numerous. For example, Science dogma states that the PARSIMONY. Therefore, the entirety of these
axioms are included in the set of Science axioms. From these [axioms] are such statements as
1. H20 is water, 2. DNA replicates, 3. Evolution gives rise to diversity of species, and 4. The
laws of the universe are universal.

If our goal is to understand God and be holy, then axiomatic systems can be compared. A system
of axioms that has few contradictions, has high predictive power, and is parsimonious and easier
to apply is more useful for that goal (and therefore has more justification) than a system that
is rife with contradictions, has little predictive power, and is bloated and tangled. Religion
being the former and Science the latter, belief in Religion is more justified than belief in
Science.

Meme 94.

In Premise 3, you use the word most. Might as well throw out your entire argument right
there. As soon as there is one thing you can't explain, the soul exists. As soon as there is one
thing you can't explain, God exists.

Then it will simply be claimed that the soul exists completely separate from the brain. And that
we have no evidence of what the afterlife is like, but that it exists, God exists, heaven and
hell exist, and we go there.

We are transcended into blissful unity with God and all other Christians, in the same way you
transcend into scientific bliss when you connect your brain to the science cloud computer, and
no longer resemble Marc in any meaningful way.

(At least, not a very meaningful way, if identity still exists in the singularity, or in the
Christian heaven.)

Meme 94 Revised.

Proof that God Exists.

1. Belief in the God of the Bible implies that senses are not deceptive.

2. Belief in one's senses forces us to believe in history, otherwise you are a holocaust denier
and an idiot.

3. Belief in history forces us to believe that Christianity is true, because goddamn something
big and important must have happened if we have all these buildings about it and people got
killed in gruesome ways over it.

4. Therefore the cultural evidence so prominently exists that Jesus rules, rocked the Roman
Empire, defied science, and invented morality.

5. Therefore God exists.

I suppose all I did was pit the credibility of history against the credibility of neuroscience.
