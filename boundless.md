# Boundless Will and Finiteness of Life

```quote
Und was der ganzen Menschheit zugeteilt ist,         And I want to savor in my inner self
Will ich in meinem innern Selbst genie\ss en,        whatever's the lot of all mankind,
Mit meinem Geist das H\"ochst' und Tiefste greifen,  to grasp the highest and deepest with my mind,
Ihr Wohl und Weh auf meinen Busen h\"aufen...        to heap man's wells and woes on my bosom...
--Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (from Faust, 1808)
```

The preceding quote by Goethe is one of my life's mottos.  When faced with a choice of 2
activities where one will give me an experience I hadn't had before while the other will be
more routine, I'll tend to go with the 1st, even if the 1st is more likely to be
unpleasant FOOTNOTE{This is true up to a point.  I've never experienced losing a limb, but I
wouldn't chop my foot off because that would limit my future possibilities.}.  It's my view
that this philosophy is useful to have and will give a person a fuller life experience.  Below,
I examine the validity of my view.

On the one hand, I want to minimize the regret I might have when I'm an 80-year-old man on my
deathbed FOOTNOTE{When faced with a situation where I'm feeling lazy or afraid, I might imagine
myself as being controlled by my 80-year-old bedridden future-self, as if future-Marc's
controlling a character in a video game.  This is a good motivator, but there are occasional
situations where I'm not sure what future-Marc will want to have done.}.  When people look back
on their lives, they tend to regret the things they haven't done, rather than the things they
have done.  I suspect my regrets will be along the lines of "I should've been braver, bolder,
and less lazy."  rather than "I was way too daring.  I should have settled into more ruts.".

On the other hand, what's the point of a full life experience and a head full of knowledge of
the world if they just die with you?  Is a life's experience useful only insofar as it leaves a
*legacy*?  To that end, how much do the philosophies that lead to a fullness of life help a
person reproduce and otherwise leave a legacy?  Should we make our rabbits adopt this
philosophy?

Life is inherently unsafe.  What feels safe will end you up as a bitter old man (after which
you die anyway).  This seems hardly a better fate than dying in a blaze of glory.

When I was 9 years old, I used a compass, ruler, and protractor to make a circular chess board.
This chess board had the same dynamics as a regular 8 by 8 grid, but it was "warped" onto an
annulus.  I naively thought that someone who was into chess would be interested in playing on
the circular board.  It'd be a new kind of chess, "circular" chess.  I was wrong.  The
differences between "square" chess and circular chess are entirely superficial.  It's the same
game underneath.

When I 1st learned to ski, I remember thinking at a very low-level action level.  I was
thinking about putting my left leg into a particular position, or shifting my weight to my
right leg.  After I learned to ski well enough, my thoughts were rarely at that level.  Instead
my thoughts were about avoiding particular obstacles, or trying to figure out a route through
the trees or moguls.  I had *abstracted away* my conscious thoughts about low-level motor
actions, and turned them into macro-actions.

--

I remember the excitement when Nintendo released its "Wii" gaming system: an entirely different
kind of controller, one that worked on motion detection rather than buttons.  When I 1st
started to play Wii, the game *did* seem different.  It took a little while to get used to the
new kind of play.  But after several hours of play, I had abstracted away the controller.  That
is, I wasn't thinking about the controller any more, but about how Link was going to acquire
some particular item, like a new sword.  It turns out that the "entirely different" controller
didn't matter at all.  It was almost entirely a surface difference.

--

My entire life, I've had more or less the same heart-rhythm and breathing pattern.  This is
predictable and boring on one level, but is unimportant and abstracted away (like the Wii
controller) on another level.

So what do I mean by deeper meaning vs. surface features?  I don't need to drive every color
of car because the color is a surface feature.

--

It's important to have a childhood.  That is, it's important to have an exploratory period so
you can try things like driving different colored cars and realize that this is just a surface
difference, with no real bearing on the actual function of the car.

Immanuel Kant spent his entire life within 100 miles of K\"onigsberg.  His life was rumored to
be so predictable that there's a story about neighbors setting their clocks by his daily walks.
At the same time, Kant definitely lived an extraordinary life, coming up with deep
philosophical ideas that no one ever had before.

When we 1st learn to write out the alphabet, we have a virtually unlimited range of styles that
we might use.  By the time we've graduated college, our handwriting is fairly solidified.
Unless we see some reason to change it (e.g., for legibility), we stick with whatever
handwriting style we're used to.  It'd take a long time to write a letter if we had to rethink
our style every time we wrote a word.  Changes, if they exist, to our handwriting after a
certain age are usually gradual.  The script on papers I wrote over a decade ago is still
recognizable as my own.  The choice of our handwriting style is rarely consciously decided, but
I'm willing to bet that a child has the ability to emulate almost anyone else's handwriting,
such that the other style becomes their own.

Our brains are like closet space: we find ways to fill them.  It's possible to let unimportant
small decisions consume us.  For example, when I worked for Sandia Nationals Laboratories in
California, I had a 3-day weekend every other week (on what was called a 9-80 schedule).  I
lived there a year, but never made it to Sequoia National Park, which was only a few hours
drive away.  More than once, I spent the entire 3-day weekend playing a video game called
"Heroes of Might and Magic III".  My brain was completely consumed by questions such as "Should
I invade this castle or produce more ranged units before doing so.".  Because I was consumed
with the game, I didn't take sufficient time to step back and consider the option of turning
the game off and going to Sequoia National Park.

Likewise, as Randy Pausch mentioned, if you spend all your time polishing the underside of the
banister, you won't have as much time for important things.

Why a person should go to Preakness once in their lives:
1. A person's *experience* is limited.
2. There are a combinatorially huge number of possible experiences a person can have.
3. Even if we exclude all the absurd possibilities, the remaining possibilities are still
   combinatorially huge.
4. Even the number of events that *have* happened or will happen (never mind the events that
   are conceivable but don't happen) in a human lifetime are vastly more than can be
   experienced by a single person.
5. Human nature errs on the side of consistency and safety.
6. Consistency makes life seem shorter.
7. Our rabbits (and us) want immortality.
8. We want minimal regret when we're old.
9. A fuller experience gives a more accurate Weltanschauung.
10. Therefore, a person should strive to experience as much as possible to have the fullest
    life experience.
11. Preakness (for me) is further outside my other experiences than most other activities I
    could think of doing.  Thus, going to Preakness (if I haven't been before) is that activity
    that will give me the widest experience.

Couldn't the same argument be applied to Why a person should be tortured by Bobo the Demon
Clown, once in their lives?  With Bobo, the cost is too high.  But how do you decide what that
line is?

There are arguments for specialization.  For example, there's Economy of Scale and Division of
Labor.  It's more efficient to have a company that specializes in making pencils and another
company that specializes in dry-cleaning laundry than to have both companies making their own
pencils and doing their own laundry.  If we spend all our time dabbling in a huge range of
activities or areas of knowledge, we won't become experts in anything.  Many fields, like
neurosurgery, require years of focused dedication, practice, and learning to become proficient.
And in a world full of dilettantes, an expert neurosurgeon would be in demand (and he would be
able to reap the rewards of that demand).

This being said, people's natural Will and behaviour tend to err too far on the side of routine
and specialization.  Because of cultural, cognitive, and genetic inertia, we're overly
influenced by fear and laziness FOOTNOTE{The fundamental idea behind the phrase "Carpe diem."
or "Seize the day." is to prevent fear and laziness from overly influencing one's actions.}.
Food used to be more scarce than it is now, so laziness, which helped conserve a scarce
resource, is less useful than it used to be.

Fear is also less useful than it used to be.  Generally, people are overly cautious.  This is
caused by cultural and maybe even genetic inertia that made sense 400 years ago when our
"safety net" was much smaller.  400 years ago, starving on the street was a more real
possibility in the western world than it is today.  Medicine also wasn't as advanced and most
occupations were more physical, so a broken leg could be more physically debilitating.  And a
loss of a functioning leg had a higher likelihood of causing you to lose your means of support
(which was more likely to be some sort of physical labor).

Mental laziness might be why we find ourselves "rolled like a hank in a cocoon of habits".
Thinking costs calories, which have been historically expensive: the brain uses 20% of our
metabolism despite being only 2% of our bodyweight.  But don't habits make sense?  Don't habits
free up cognitive resources?  It's human nature to fall into ruts.  Habits make life easier.
For example, if I had to rethink about how to dry myself off every time I took a shower, or how
to walk or write, I wouldn't get much done.  Likewise, when I shattered the top joint of my
right index finger, I found out just how many habits I had.  I was painfully reminded of my
habits every time I "forgot" and tried to use the finger to tie my shoes, get dressed, etc..  I
try to minimize cognitive overhead by consistency: e.g., always putting my keys in the same
spot.  Habits are how we avoid having to think about things.  On the other hand, ruts and an
aversion for the unfamiliar can prevent a person from fully experiencing life, causing him to
live the same day over and over.  Furthermore, people tend to get trapped in cycles too easily.
Habits are the embodiment of laziness and fear.  Both of these have their uses, but our brains
developed in an era when physical threats were plentiful (so fear was necessary), but food was
not (so laziness was necessary).  So, people are "tuned" to have too much of these for our
current environment.  Both our instincts and our culture are victims of this environmental
inertia.  So habits can be useful, but it's important to be mindful that humans' natural
tendencies err far on the side of consistency.  Knowing this, I try to consciously remind
myself of this, and will often take deliberate actions to step outside of my comfort zone.  I
also have to ask myself what the potential harm is in getting into a routine.

Even the neurosurgeon's training would suffer if he keeps doing the same routine operations.
My friend, Gabe, said when he was in high school, after a heavy snow he would drive his car to
an empty parking lot and do donuts and otherwise play around.  Although the authorities
discouraged this, he pointed out that this was a useful experience for him: it taught him the
dynamics of the car in non-standard conditions and how to handle the car if he ever starts to
skid on some ice.  Thus, his exploration earlier probably prevented him from getting into at
least a few accidents.

> Moderation is liberation.

> --Jason Pickett (1998)

There are arguments for having a wide range of experiences.  The *Pareto
Principle* FOOTNOTE{This is not to be confused with the concept of *Pareto Optimality* from
\meme{47}.  Though both are named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto.} (also called
the 80/20 rule) states that, for many systems, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the
causes.  To attain an expert level in (or 100% mastery of) many domains, such as hang gliding
or neurosurgery, a good deal of time must be invested, but a 90% mastery will probably take
roughly 10% of the effort.  For example, suppose you want to learn to a new language.  Zipf's
law states that, "In a natural language (such as Swedish or English), the frequency of a word
is inversely proportional to its rank in frequency.".  So the 100 most frequent words in
written English ({\tt the}, {\tt of}, {\tt and}, {\tt to}, {\tt a}, {\tt in}, etc.)  will
account for nearly *half* of the words in a document.  So, if you learn just these 100 words,
you'll already be able to understand half the words in a given document.  If you learn 1000
words (and the basic rules of grammar), you'll be able to understand most sentences in a
language.  But the typical vocabulary of a language contains tens of thousands of words.
English is estimated to have at least 50,000 root words.  Even the artificial language
Esperanto, which prides itself on its small vocabulary has 15,000-20,000 root words.  So a
complete mastery of the vocabulary of a language would take over 50 times the time to learn "a
basic understanding".  Thus, a person could attain basic understanding in 50 languages, or
totally master a single language.  Similarly, you can reach 90% mastery of being a Family
Practice doctor with the first 10% of the effort (since most patients are the "common cases"
for which you quickly learn what to do).

On the other hand, there are cases where expertise is necessary, where having a 90% mastery
simply won't do.  For example, a sprinter who runs 90% as fast as the fastest won't make the
olympics, even if he also throws the javelin put 90% as far as the best javelin.  On the other
other hand, such an athlete might be preferred company on a spear-hunting expedition.

> Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
>
> --The 1st sentence of Anna Karenina (1873), by Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy

In developing a model of The World, its useful to know about outliers.  Although most cases are
common, it's useful to spend a disproportionate amount of time learning about the "unhappy
families" because the variety in these 10% is so big.  For example, if we wanted to write a 100
page pamphlet on mammals you might see in Colorado, a "proportional" pamphlet would have 90
pages of the book devoted to the ubiquitous prairie dogs, with chipmunks, bison, elk, big horn
sheep, black bears, mountain lions, etc. crammed into the remaining 10 pages.  In reality,
although you might devote a few more pages to the more common animals, a more useful pamphlet
would have roughly the same number of pages for both prairie dogs and mountain
lions FOOTNOTE{Mountain lions are rarely seen in Colorado.  I lived in Colorado for 18 years,
and I never saw a mountain lion in the wild, though I saw thousands of prairie dogs.}.
Experience has a number of dimensions that are difficult to capture through other means (books,
photos, films).  Thus, it's hard to find a substitute for learning through experience.  This is
another reason it's useful to have experiences far outside what you've already experienced.

Learning about a wide variety of fields also allows for generalization and transfer of
principles.  For example, I've learned to ski, hang glide, and touch type.  By doing each of
these, I was able to developed a theory about how low-level motor actions become abstracted (in
our cerebellum) so that they're no longer conscious.  This pattern wouldn't have been as easily
noticeable to me if I hadn't done this range of activities.  Another example would be
automobile traffic and fluid dynamics.  If a person learned about both, he'd see a good deal of
overlap.  Sometimes cars behave like a fluid FOOTNOTE{Sometimes cars behave very much unlike a
fluid.  Traffic can be complex and nonlinear.}.

A wide experience also helps broaden our perspective.  With a limited set of data, we might
feel that we've characterized The World, when in reality we've only glimpsed a tiny part of it.
Even if a wide experience doesn't help you much to characterize the rest of The World, it will
at least give you some sense of how much you don't know.

--

Ignorance is the product of a narrow context.  If we have a large set of outliers, unexplained
data, or incorrect predictions, we realize how imperfect our Weltanschauung is.  If we spend
all our time in a limited context, we'll begin to forget that there are things outside of that
context.  For example, when Gabe and I were in a pub in Malm\"o:

> It was interesting that Gabe and I hadn't heard of the Euro 2004 until we got to Sweden.

There's no substitute for experience.  But you can reach a point of diminishing returns, where
new experiences are so similar to old ones that it's not worth the effort.  For example,
cathedrals in Europe, though each individually amazing, start to look like each other after a
while.  Also, with more and more experience, you learn a better mapping between what's written
down and what the experience is actually like.

[#]: Marcpoint
Suppose you were supposed to memorize the following sequence of numbers:
```quote
0, 1, 3, 8, 15, 24, 35, 48, 63, 80, 99
```
If you were given only the first few numbers, you'd only be able to rote memorize them.  But,
as the sequence goes on, you'd start to notice a pattern: the numbers are just 1 less than the
sequence of squares of 1 through 10.  That is the $n$th number is $n^2 - 1$.

--

In immersive language learning, we start to pick up on patterns like this too.  For example, if
we're learning Korean we might learn from context that "Ojingoe juseyo." means "I'd like some
squid." and "Nae hoebuhkeurapeuteuneun jangoero kadeuk cha itseyo." means "My hovercraft is
full of eels".  At this point, you wouldn't know how to say "My hovercraft is full of squid.".
But if you also knew that "Jangoe juseyo." meant "I'd like some eel.", then you could deduce
the words for eel and squid and perhaps construct the sentence "Nae hoebuhkeurapeuteuneun
**ojingoero** kadeuk cha itseyo.".  This is another example where more knowledge allows for a
more compressed Weltanschauung.  Initially we were given only 2 sentences and could only
reproduce those 2, but with the 3rd sentence, we are able to generalize and we can construct at
least 4 sentences.

--

Whenever I tour a new town (or even a new building), I like the feeling of everything falling
into place.  For example, when I first went to high school, I used a system of landmarks to
help me navigate the wings of the building.  Eventually, I started "connecting the dots".  I
would figure out that the computer lab was next to the math room and in front of the teachers'
offices, whereas before, these 3 landmarks were disconnected.  When things fell into place, I
discarded my system of landmarks for the more parsimonious "map" that I'd built in my head.

--

This phenomenon, things falling into place or "clicking" at a certain point after a sufficient
amount of learning, happens in a broad range of areas of knowledge: how cars work, human
anatomy, the history of the Roman Empire, etc..  The problem is that if we didn't spend enough
time learning about a field, we wouldn't reach this point, and we wouldn't have a real
understanding of the field.

The conclusion here is that it's useful to know that these click-points exist, and it's good to
reach them if it's not too much effort.  Knowing a lot about a lot of areas can help a person
develop the meta-knowledge that will let them estimate how much effort will need to go into a
new area before it clicks (and whether it's worth it).

If we vary our experience, then our life at least *seems* longer and more full of events.  The
explanation for this is related to the "chairlift phenomenon":

I don't know that having life *seem* longer is useful in itself.  It could be just putting our
heads in the sand, but I can't escape the idea that a variety of experiences will produce a
more fulfilling life.  Would our rabbits do better if they wanted their lives to seem longer?
Well, we'd at least want for our rabbits to want to live a long time FOOTNOTE{There are
arguments that it's evolutionarily advantageous *for a species* if the individuals have shorter
lifespans.  The reasoning goes that a shorter lifespan allows for quicker evolution, which
makes the species more adaptable to environmental changes.}, or a long-lived rabbit would
survive and reproduce more than a short-lived one.  I think a diversity of experience allows
for a better world-model, which is useful for the rabbits' survival and reproduction.

--

On the other hand, fragmenting your life into too many slices can make it seem shorter.  I'm a
slow reader.  It takes me about 40 hours of reading to finish a book, and I read about an hour
each day.  If I read 30 different books at once, reading a different book every day of the
month, it'll take me years to finish any of them.  If I looked at any book, I'd think "Wow.  I
started this book 3 years ago, and I'm still not finished.".

[#]: [fullness of life and limited time] vs. [reproduction and purpose of experience]

The purpose of a cognitive system is to characterize and make predictions about The World.  For
reasons described above, it'd make sense for a cognitive system to want to learn as much as
possible.  I call this thirst for knowledge {\mgreek ja$\wideparen{\textrm{\mgreek u}}$ma},
which is the open-eyed wonder that impels us to explore The World, a sort of intense curiosity.
Our rabbits should have {\mgreek ja$\wideparen{\textrm{\mgreek u}}$ma} too, but balanced by
fear and laziness.  After all, *exploring* The World comes at a cost of *exploiting* what is
known already.  How much to explore vs. exploit depends on how much life you expect to have
yet, so when you're young it makes sense to explore and have a diversity of experiences.

It makes sense to be curious and acquire lots of knowledge without an obvious use.

A drive related to {\mgreek ja$\wideparen{\textrm{\mgreek u}}$ma} is what I call Boundless
Will.  This is the Will to do everything, to pop every push, to tie up all loose ends, to
travel all paths, to get to know everyone, to find all patterns, to experience all of the
combinatorially huge number of possibilities.  It'd make sense to give our rabbits a boundless
Will (see **Walking = Falling + Catching**).  So how do they (we) achieve this well?

***

I read once somewhere that the the academic being is ever a child, or at least ever filled with
a child's sense of wonder (i.e., deeply motivated by {\mgreek ja$\wideparen{\textrm{\mgreek
u}}$ma}).

I've always been reluctant to "grow up".  Because after growing up comes growing old, and after
growing old comes death.  Perhaps I implicitly believe that if I can stall growing up, then I
can stall death.  It might be because of this, but I get disturbed when my friends'
conversations turns to buying and remodeling their houses.  It seems so mundane.  Of all the
boundless possible topics of conversation, all the Gedankenexperiments to be investigated, all
the analysis of historical trends, the rise and fall of empires, the topic chosen is so often
whether to go with oak or cherry cabinets for the kitchen.  Maybe the realities of mundane life
will force me into this abyss, but I think the fate I dread is at least escapable.  While in
high school, we were as the chimpanzees in the Arnhem zoo: the basic necessities are
automatically taken care of, and all that is left is politics and peacock's tails.

If you have children, it seems you'll be faced with life's real problems: mortgages, car
insurance, school-district zones.  This is what will be on your plate, so this is where your
interests will be.  In high school, there seemed to be so many paths, and possibilities.  It
seems that as one gets older, one falls on this well trampled path of practicality.  There
seems to be a lack of friends and socialization, a lack of intellectual fervor, of
philosophical pondering, of wonder, of {\mgreek ja$\wideparen{\textrm{\mgreek u}}$ma}.  Thus,
one passes from the phase of exploration to that of exploitation.

In life there are again so many combinations, but a fairly common story is to graduate from
high school at 18, graduate from college at 22, get a job, marry, buy a house, have kids, then
retire.  This might sound uninteresting, but it works.  It causes people to be successful.  It
does the job of reproduction.  (And isn't there room for creativity elsewhere?)

Our rabbits can live The Unexamined Life and still be successful in our eyes (i.e.,
evolutionarily successful).  Real rabbits reproduce just fine without having the barest inkling
of the meaning of any of what they're doing.

The World can hold only a tiny fraction of all possibilities.  If I'm dealt a particular hand
of Gin Rummy, I only get that single hand, but there are 15,820,024,219 possible hands I'm not
being dealt.  Before the hand was dealt, there were almost 16 billion hands it could've been,
but it had to be only one of those.

There are many instruments that people have invented, and even more ways to possibly make
sound.  For example, I could invent an "instrument" that makes sounds by throwing various sized
rubber balls against a racquetball court wall.  Then there are also existing instruments such
as the Jew's harp, the didgeridoo, and the theremin, but most bands that I see in Baltimore
typically have a vocalist, a guitar, a bass guitar, and a set of drums.  This seems to be only
a tiny slice of the unimaginably large number of possibilities for a band.

I'm sure there are some musical reasons why the standard music set is better than a band with
an accordian, a didgeridoo, a jew's harp, and no drums.  But I can't help but suspect that the
standard set is largely a historical accident, and continues to exist largely due to cultural
inertia.

There are also an unimaginably large number of things a person could do on a Friday night: one
could build Lego creations. One could attend a painting party in which the guests all paint
portraits of each other.  One could play parlor games.  One could lock themselves up in a
library with friends, everyone grabbing stacks of books on ideas they're interested in.  My
friend, Dan Bernstein, recommended fetal position night, in which the attendees stay in fetal
position the entire night.  Yet, the selection in most cities seems to be typically limited to
going to a bar or going to a theatre.

Eggs Benedict seems pretty arbitrary: A poached egg and Canadian bacon on an English muffin
covered with Hollandaise sauce.  If we allow 2 combinations for each part of this menu item
(e.g. egg over-easy instead of poached), then there would be 16 combinations.  Yet none of
these are specially named.

On one hand you have the combinatorial explosion of possible outcomes, and the tiny
perturbations and chance happenings that cause decks of cards to fall into a particular order.
On the other hand you have Mutual Information and convergence, which say that many outcomes are
basically equivalent.

As an example of the latter, when I was 8, my parents took me to the Humane Society to get a
puppy.  There were dozens to choose from, and I chose one from a particular litter of 6 or 7
puppies.  My decision was rather arbitrary in that the only difference I could see in the
puppies was their coloration.  So in choosing 1 puppy (that I later named "Oreo"), I excluded
the 5 or 6 other puppies.  Also, in choosing a future with Oreo, I also excluded at least 5 or
6 other futures with the other puppies.  My question here is "Does it matter?".  Would all
these futures have been basically equivalent?

I only have so many days before I die, and I want to have the whole human experience as fully
as possible, and it bugs me that there are some things that I'll have died without doing.
Along similar lines, I view it as a little tragedy every time I pass a stranger on the
sidewalk.  Here's this full interesting person with dreams, concepts, a family, and a life
story.  If the stranger and I were stranded on a desert island for 20 years, we'd probably end
up as good friends, and I'd still never fully figure the person out.  Yet, all those
possibilities are quashed as we walk past.

Consciousness is seemingly infinite (or at least combinatorially unbound), but life is very
finite ($<$ 51,135 days (140 years) and usually closer to 29,400 days (80 years)).  In that
time, we can't possibly conceive all possible thoughts or dream all possible dreams.

Our highest level concepts are probably formed very early in life, and some of these concepts
are influenced implicitly by our early experiences.  These might be things like good and bad
(maybe the very idea of good and bad), that to have effect you have to take an action, etc..

In working on artificial developmental learning, I've come under the suspicion that the amount
of new information put into our heads after the age of 3 might be *less* than the amount of
information that was in our heads by the time we're 3.  Tacit knowledge that we don't usually
think about, like recognizing physical objects, object permanence, and inertia, might be more
difficult to describe starting from scratch, than are the ideas in a college Complex Variables
course, when using those fundamental concepts as building blocks.  Paul Cohen (my academic
grandfather) once noted that the concepts that an army General uses to plan battle strategy are
fundamentally the same as those his 3-year-old daughter uses to push blocks around a table.
Therefore, a good deal of the knowledge that's in my head is also in everyone else's head.  So
the amount of knowledge in my head that's unique might actually be pretty small.  The amount of
knowledge that's unique to me, and not directly related to me (e.g., no one else knows that I
read a Sherlock Holmes story last night) is even smaller.

I consider this a good thing though.  This is because I'm interested in the whole human
experience.  The day I graduated from college, I was depressed because I had the thought that
"That *was* my undergrad experience.".  There were all the paths that I could have taken, but
that was it.  I was allowed only one path.  ("Einmal ist keinmal." (Once is never.) I read
years later in Milan Kundera's "Unbearable Lightness of Being".)  There were all the movies
that you saw about college and all the crazy times, and not all those were part of my college
experience.  So, I want to experience everything.  I want to be everywhere and know everything,
but there simply isn't time in my "expected" 29,400 days.  It's the finiteness of life vs. the
infinity of possibilities.  Mutual Information mitigates this.  There are a large number of
paths that all lead to pretty much the same state.  So, Jim's experiences might be radically
different from mine, but the distance between the information content in our heads might not
reflect that.  The laws of the universe work the same always and everywhere, so most of what
Jim learned in his experiences might be fundamentally the same as what I learned in my
experiences.

My current answer to the question I asked at the beginning of this section ("What's the point
of a full life experience and a head full of knowledge of the world if they just die with
you?") is this: a full life experience gives a person a better Weltanschauung.  Just as it's
useful to have a full encyclopedia even if few people read every entry in it, it's still useful
to have a well-developed Weltanschauung so that a person can make use of the relevant parts if
the need arises.  Because of evolutionary and cultural inertia, we tend to err far on the side
of fear and laziness.  So a constant effort must be put forth to combat these forces.
