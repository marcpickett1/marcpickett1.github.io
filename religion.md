# There is no Abrahamic God: Why Religion isn't the Answer

[#]: ))))((((

I don't believe that the meaning of life has anything to do with the Abrahamic religions (i.e.,
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) because fundamental to these religions is the belief in the
god of Hebrew mythology, commonly known as "God".

### Are Religion and Science equally justified?
[#]: )))(((

One could claim that Science and Religion are both axiomatic belief systems.  That is, both
science and religion start with a set of assumptions (e.g., "God exists." for religion, and
Ockham's Razor for Science) that have no backing and on which other beliefs are based.  Since
Science and Religion are both systems of axioms, one might claim that there is no fundamental
difference between them, and therefore, belief in Religion is as justified as belief in
Science.

However, Science isn't a set of specific beliefs, but rather a set of principles for generating
beliefs, so the axioms are few.  For example, Newton's 3rd Law of Motion (i.e., "For every
action there is an equal and opposite reaction.")  is *not* a core belief of science.  The core
tenets of science allow that Newton's generalization might not be entirely correct.  When
Newton proposed this law, it was the most parsimonious theory that explained observations.  The
tenets of Science allow both that a more parsimonious explanation might still be found and that
new observations might be made which Newton's 3rd Law will be unable to explain.  By contrast,
the axioms of religions are specific and numerous.  For example, Christian dogma states that
the scriptures are divinely inspired.  Therefore, the entirety of these scriptures (several
hundred pages) are included in the set of Christian axioms.  Within these are such statements
as 1. Jesus rose from the dead, 2. belief in Jesus grants one eternal life, 3. Jesus was
born of a virgin, and 4. Jesus turned water into wine.

If our goal is to understand The World and make predictions, then axiomatic systems *can* be
compared.  A system of axioms that has few contradictions, has high predictive power, and is
parsimonious and easier to apply is more useful for that goal (and therefore has more
justification) than a system that is rife with contradictions, has little predictive power, and
is bloated and tangled.  Science being the former and Religion the latter, belief in Science is
more justified than belief in Religion.

### Proof of God's Non-existence
[#]: )))(((

It's sometimes claimed that it's impossible to disprove the existence of God.  While it's true
that to disprove the existence of some things, such as a diamond the exact size and dimensions
of the Statue of Liberty, one would have to exhaustively search all the corners of the universe
and show that such an implausible diamond doesn't exist anywhere.  However, it's possible to
disprove the existence of God the same way we can disprove the existence of the largest prime
number: namely, that assumption of its attributes results in a contradiction.  My proof runs as
follows:

1. Belief in the God of the Bible implies the belief that people have non-material souls
   which are sentient and live on after a person's body has died.
2. Belief in the God of the Bible also implies that one's own senses are not deliberately
   deceptive because God, by definition, is righteous, has an extreme affinity for truth and
   honesty, is infallible, and is the creator of a person and their senses.  This means that
   I'm not a brain in a vat deliberately led to believe in a false universe.  (This was
   Descartes' argument for being able to believe his senses.)
3. Belief in one's senses forces one to believe in many of the findings of neuroscience.
   Namely, that most of the processes formerly attributed to soul have been proven to be
   properties of a material brain.
4. Since these properties are properties of a physical brain, they can't also be properties of
   a non-material soul, because this implies either redundancy or contradiction (in that a
   property of the non-material soul may disagree with that of the physical brain).  If it's
   redundancy, then a person's soul would be damaged if we damaged a person's brain.  When a
   person dies, and his brain is destroyed (by rot and worms), redundancy would imply that the
   overlapping parts of the soul would also be destroyed.  Neuroscience has established that by
   physically affecting a person's brain, one can cause the person to have mental changes.
   (For example, would an Alzheimer's patient still be short of memory in his afterlife?  What
   about a person who had suffered severe brain damage?  Would their soul be catatonic in the
   afterlife?)  To say that the brain is a physical manifestation of the soul (like a shadow is
   of a physical object) doesn't help this problem because shooting my shadow's legs doesn't
   impair my ability to run, but damaging our brain does impair our ability to think.
5. Therefore, neuroscience implies that there's little left to the non-material soul.  So
   little, in fact, that we could hardly consider the non-material soul to be sentient (any
   more than we could consider a severely brain-damaged catatonic person to be sentient).  This
   is contrary to 1.

One can reconcile this contradiction by altering the definition of God.  However, any
alteration sufficient to do this would have to be so fundamental that I would no longer apply
the term "Abrahamic God" to the new concept.

One can also reconcile this contradiction by dropping 1.  Namely, by claiming that one can
believe in God without believing in a non-material soul.  But belief in an afterlife is central
to the teachings of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.
