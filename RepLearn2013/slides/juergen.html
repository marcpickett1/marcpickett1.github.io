    <h1>Juergen Schmidhuber's RepLearn 2013 Talk Overview</h1>

    My lab has been working on Deep Learning Neural Networks (NN) since
    1991 [1-9]. Back then computers were a million times slower than
    today. With today's hardware, however, both our recurrent [3,4] and
    our feedforward [5,7-9] deep NN now outperform traditional methods on
    a routine basis [4-9]. In particular, in 2009, they became the first
    Deep Learners to win official international pattern recognition
    competitions [4]; by 2012 they had won eight of them [6] (far more
    than methods by any other group). In 2011, our GPU-based NN achieved
    the first superhuman visual pattern recognition results [5].
