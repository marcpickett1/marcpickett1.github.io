	    <h2>Motivation and Relevance</h2> <p> A human-level
	      artificially intelligent agent must be able to represent
	      and reason about the world, at some level, in terms of
	      high-level concepts such as entities and relations.
	      The problem of acquiring these rich high-level
	      representations, known as the <i>knowledge acquisition
	      bottleneck</i>, has long been an obstacle for achieving
	      human-level AI. A popular approach to this problem
	      is to handcraft these high-level representations, but this
	      has had limited success. An alternate approach is for rich
	      representations to be learned autonomously from low-level
	      sensor data. Potentially, the latter approach may
	      yield more robust representations, and should rely less on
	      human knowledge-engineering.</p>

	      <h2>Topics</h2>
	      <p> We are interested in all parts of the bridge between
		low-level-sensors and rich high-level representations and
		their use in reasoning tasks.  This includes but is not
		limited to: </p>
	      <dl>
		<li> Learning concept hierarchies from sensor data.</li>
		<li>Representing and learning invariant concepts.</li>
		<li>Postulating objects and theoretical entities.</li>
		<li>Postulating relations from sensor data, when the data is not explicitly relational.</li>
		<li>Learning symbolic representations from numerical sensor data.</li>
		<li>High-level reasoning grounded in robotic sensors and effectors.</li>
		<li>Sensor-grounded research on cognitive architectures.</li>
	      </dl>

	      <h2>Format</h2>
	      <p> This one-day workshop will begin with an explanation
		of the workshop's focus and research overview.  We will
		decompose the workshop into themes that concern learning
		rich representations from sensor data: tasks, techniques,
		evaluations, or demonstrations.  We will include invited
		talks from senior researchers who can summarize their
		long-term research on this topic.  We will also include
		one or more panels that focus on the themes listed above,
		and their challenges.</p>
